## Instructions

This is a memory Game, when the user clicks on a card, it is turned face-up,
the user then clicks on another card and turns it face-up. If both cards match,
a pair is created and both cards are left face-up. However, if it is a mismatch,
both cards are turned face-down and the user gets another chance to match a pair.
This continues till the user has matched all cards.  There is a timer above that
keeps track of how the long the user takes as well as how many moves it takes
the user to complete the game.
